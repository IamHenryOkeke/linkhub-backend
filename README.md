# LinkHub Backend

A backend API for a Linktree-like service where users can create a profile page with multiple customizable links, enabling easy sharing of all social profiles or important links with a single URL.

---

## Features

- User registration and login (email/password and OAuth)
- Email verification workflow for user accounts
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for managing user links (create, read, update, delete)
- Public user profiles accessible by username, showing all links
- Role-based user validation (e.g., only verified users can log in)
- Structured error handling with custom error classes

---

## Technology Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- OAuth 2.0 (Google) for social login
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- dotenv for environment variables

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- Google OAuth credentials (for social login)
- An email SMTP service for sending verification emails
